Webcam Image Identification
	Layman's terms: combine AI with codey-code to ultimately identify specific targets (color tracking, ASL translator, facial recognition?)

Baby steps
1.) program that identifies the hex of a specific pixel that the mouse is pointing at
	1a.) associate the hex with a basic color: Red, Yellow, Blue, Green, Purple, Orange, Black, White, Brown?
	1b.) broaden the pixel range and identify the most prevelant hex of that range (get the average color?)
2.) program that identifies shapes (use AI? idek what that is anymore)

Questions!
what program would we use?
	what "ai" would we be using? 
	where are we getting our database? - open source something, or ourselves???
		supervised vs. unsupervised vs. deep learning
